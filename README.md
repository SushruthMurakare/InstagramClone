An android application built using react native and expo which is an instagram clone.
Technologies : 
1. React native
2. NativeWind (Tailwind for react native:) )
3. Expo router





What I learnt : 
1. The quality of image loaded should be based on the image size of the screen , if you are loading HD images for a very small sized imaged (ex: profile image on the feed screen) it is uneccessary.
2. Once the user tries to open the image then we can fetch the HD image on the go
